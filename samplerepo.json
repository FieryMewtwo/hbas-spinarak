Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.\\n\\nIntended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.\\n\\nThis uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.\\n\\nThere are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).\\n- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.\\n- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.\\n\\nThe reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.\\n\\nCredits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.\\n\\nSource included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.",

Binary *.bin files will have an option to be launched as payloads if Atmosph\u00e8re is detected running.\\n\\nThe old title manager has been refactored. Now, it can show ANY kind of content located in any partition, from system data archives to DLCs and updates, and regular titles. All of them can be removed individually.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability to detect the CFW currently running, which gets displayed on the CFW menu.\\n\\nNow the web browser is accessible even if Goldleaf isn't an installed title. It will use the WifiLogin web-applet, which has some limitations, but at least it's something.\\n\\nContent mounting (like NAND when being browsed or the NSPs when being installed) has been refactored to minimize any filesystem issues.\\n\\nSome icons were changed: NROs have a new icon, NCAs have now the old NROs icon...\\n\\nNSP exporting now warns with titles which are 4GB or higher, for risk preventing.\\n\\nUSB has been quite improved with experimental threads' syncing, which seems to make it more stable.\\n\\nRegular installs check for free size now.\\n\\nTickets show if they're used or not, so unused ones should be safe to remove.\\n\\nBoth USB and regular installations abort if the title is already installed.\\n\\nMinor fixes and corrections on texts and several options.\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nNow it's checked that the base folders inside \"sd:/goldleaf\" are created before entering certain menus.\\n\\nFile browsers won't refresh the current directory's contents after copying a file as it was pointless and caused delay.\\n\\nThis version of Goldleaf supports libnx v2.0.0, which fixed a few bugs with USB, and also added native keyboard support.\\n\\nNow files and directories can be renamed in file browsers using the native keyboard.\\n\\nNow new files or directories can be created (files will be empty) by pressing L (for files) or R (for directories) in a file browser.\\n\\nNow the star feature, NSP dumping! This is quite experimental though, and could be unstable. Be careful using it!\\n\\nAnother console memory partition can be browsed appart from the three others: PRODINFOF\\n\\nBrief information about the different partitions is displayed when selecting the console memory browser.\\n\\nThe path of the key file has been moved from \"sd:/goldleaf/\" to \"sd:/switch/\" as other homebrews use this path.\\n\\nAfter removing tickets no dialog will be shown, the footer will inform of the process instead.\\n\\nThe top part of Goldleaf has been redesigned, which has a mini-text for the current menu. (e.g. current directory in SD card or console memory browsers)\\n\\nA warning dialog is displayed selecting USB installation as it's quite unstable for the moment.\\n\\nFixed small bugs with SD card NSP installation.\\n\\nNow file/directory copying has a progress bar to follow the copy process, instead of freezing the UI.\\n\\nWEB BROWSER! Yeah, you've read right, Goldleaf is the first homebrew tool to provide support for the console's internal browser.\\n\\nAccount manager! You can replace user's icon, delete them or rename them. Anyway, replacing the icon can be dangerous and banbait!\\n\\nNow no cert files are required to install a ticket, not even with NSP installs or USB installs. Goldleaf contains the public cert directly.\\n\\nMinor fixes on several dialogs and texts.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nSupposedly, now those random crashes browsing menus or filesystems are fixed now.\\n\\nWhen looking for the key file for NCAs or themes, now more names are supported (not just keys.dat): keys.dat, prod.keys, keys.txt or keys.ini.\\n\\nFixed bug which would not install the selected theme if qlaunch was not extracted, and it would just extract it without processing the theme.\\n\\nNow title 0100000000001013 is installed to qlaunch directory, previously user page themes wouldn't work for this issue.\\n\\nv0.1\\n\\nFirst Release",

            "details": "Easy-to-use title installer & manager for Nintendo Switch\\n\\nIf you are looking for Tinfoil, this is Tinfoil's safer and way more extended evolution.\\nBrief description\\nGoldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing,\\n\\nYou can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.\\n\\nIf you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\nInstalling NSP packages can be dangerous.\\n\\nKeep in mind that there will always be a ban risk, and that NSPs with tickets are specially dangerous.\\n\\nIf you want to be safe, avoid connecting to the internet via airplane mode, or block Nintendo's services via special tools such as 90DNS.\\n\\nGoldleaf simply provides support for a normal NSP and/or ticket installation. The way you use them or the risks you are taking are your problem.\\n\\nGoldleaf gives the user the possibility to modify NAND files, by deleting them or allowing to copy new files there.\\n\\nThis can be dangerous, as deleting NCAs from the NAND contents can lead to unfixable errors. Image deleting all the EXE and DLL files from System32 folder. Well, the result would be similar.\\n\\nRemoving tickets from installed contents will make the system not to be able to recognise them as \"legit\" purchased, so it will refuse to launch them (in many cases, but NOT all cases)\\n\\nMain features\\nSD card and NAND browser\\n\\nA very simple but, in my opinion, one of the most useful features in Goldleaf. Just a file browser for the SD card or for NAND partitions, providing special support for some file formats:\\n\\nNSP (Nintendo Submission Package)\\n\\nIt's the official format used by Nintendo to provide installable content from their CDN servers.\\n\\nTechnically, it's a PFS0 (a simple file format containing several files) with NCA contents, sometimes XML and/or icon metadata (exported by official packaging tools), and a ticket and a cert in case they are signed with a titlekey (games are, system contents aren't).\\n\\nGoldleaf can install NSPs same way other official apps would, like DevMenu.\\n\\nAs a warning, I do not recommend installing NSPs in case you plan to go online. Installing content from unofficial tools (such as Goldleaf or the old Tinfoil) can lead to permanent bans from online services, and in severe cases, from every Nintendo service, even from updating the console or games. Install NSPs at your own risk.\\n\\nNRO (Nintendo Relocatable Object)\\n\\nOfficially is treated as a dynamic library object, similar to DLLs on Windows. This are loaded dynamically by applications at runtime.\\n\\nHomebrew uses them as executable binaries because as they can contain multiple data sections, we can use them to load extra info such as NACP (title, author and version), an icon, or even RomFs data to access at runtime.\\n\\nGoldleaf has the ability of launching NROs located at the SD card. Keep in mind that this feature usually can cause undefined behavior due to some difficulties cleaning up graphics so quickly.\\n\\nNCA (Nintendo Content Archive)\\n\\nThis format is the base format used by Horizon OS to store content.\\n\\nWhile the previously mentioned formats don't require any kind of cryptography to be extracted or used, NCAs have to be decrypted, so the user is required to provide the required keys to extract the content.\\n\\nNCAs have different sections, as well as other information. The two main sections are the ExeFs and RomFs: the ExeFs filesystem contains the code NSO binaries and a NPDM metadata file, while the RomFs contains different files to be accessed from the title.\\n\\nSome NCAs could also contain a special section, which is the section 0. This section contains the PNG and GIF logos displayed at the top-left and botton-right of the console when launching a title.\\n\\nNCAs don't have neccessarily those two sections. The program NCA, the base of any application or applet, will contain an ExeFs, and usually a RomFs in case it's a game or a system title with resources like settings or Home Menu.\\n\\nAppart from program NCAs there are some other NCA types: control NCA (NACP and icons), legalinfo NCA (HTML manuals and information), offline NCA (HTML documents in case the title wants to load them) content meta CNMT NCA (with title specific information)...\\n\\nGoldleaf has embedded hactool in his code, so it can extract those partitions from NCAs, if the keys are provided.\\n\\nNXTheme (Home Menu theme)\\n\\nThis format is developed by Qcean team, a format to handle Home Menu layout modding.\\n\\n+Goldleaf can install them, but it needs to have Home Menu's RomFs at sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch. If the keys used with other formats are provided, Goldleaf itself will locate the console's qlaunch and extract it to that directory.\\n\\nYou will have to reboot with CFW after installing a theme to see any changes.\\n\\nNACP (Nintendo Application Control Property)\\n\\nThis is the format used by Nintendo to store a title's name, version, author name and other information, like if the title supports screnshots or video captures.\\n\\nGoldleaf can parse a NACP file and display some of it's information.\\n\\nTickets and certificates\\n\\nTickets (.tik) and certificates (.cert) are the format used by Nintendo to provide encryption data for titlekey-signed titles (almost every game).\\n\\nNSPs usually contain them, and Goldleaf can install them if they are located in the SD card.\\n\\nTo install a ticket you will have to provide a certificate, both with the same name and in the same directory, with their extension. (example: sd:/game.tik and sd:/game.cert)\\n\\nThe NAND browser has almost the same support, but it's reccomended to use it only to export files via copying them to the SD card, to avoid any trouble. Goldleaf should warn when doing dangerous operations anyway.\\n\\nUSB installer and Goldtree\\n\\nYou can install NSPs via USB using Goldtree, a C# PC client to handle this installations.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB installations are a bit unstable, and might bug sometimes.\\n\\nTitle manager\\n\\nGoldleaf's title manager will display all the titles installed in the system, both SD, NAND and the one in the gamecart if inserted.\\n\\nYou can view these titles' information, icon, install location and Application Id.\\n\\nTitles can also be completely uninstalled here. Keep in mind that deleting a title won't delete its savedata, that should stay on the system.\\n\\nTicket manager\\n\\nGoldleaf can get all the tickets installed on the console. While some of them will contain the name of the title they belong to, some could belong to DLC or other types of content despite not belonging directly to a title.\\n\\nYou can view the Application Id and the key generation of a ticket by selecting it.\\n\\nTickets can also be removed from the console. Removing tickets can be a dangerous option, as without them, titlekey-signed won't be allowed to boot by Home Menu.\\n\\nCFW configuration\\n\\nThis is mostly a useful menu for checking which CFWs are in the SD card and whichof them have any Home Menu modifications, meaning that a theme is probably installed there.\\n\\nYou can delete any Home Menu modifications of a certain CFW after selecting a CFW.\\n\\nConsole information\\n\\nOn this option, you can check the used size of the SD card, the entire NAND, and on the different NAND partitions.\\n\\nIt also displays the current firmware version the console is.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nDisplays Goldleaf's logo and whether Goldleaf is running as a NRO from hbmenu or as a normal title.\\n\\nAs some other miscellaneous options, you can easily reboot or shut down your console from Goldleaf, by pressing ZL or ZR in any moment.\\n\\nProviding keys\\nIf you provide a file with several Switch keys (commonly named as prod.keys or keys.dat) you will be able to do some extra stuff with Goldleaf: (remember that you have to place it as sd:/goldleaf/keys.dat)\\n\\nUnless you already have dumped qlaunch's (aka Home Menu) RomFs (or at least the files within lyt folder) in sd:/goldleaf/qlaunch directory, you will need to provide the previously mentioned key file with several keys, so that Goldleaf can extract directly the RomFs of the console's qlaunch contents to use it.\\n\\nYou have the option to extract NCA contents (ExeFs, RomFs or section 0), but you will need the previously mentioned keys too.\\n\\nGoldtree and USB installs\\nUSB communication is slightly different from Tinfoil's one, so Tinfoil's old Python script, AluminumFoil nor other tools won't work properly.\\n\\nGoldtree will ask you to choose a NSP after establishing connection with Goldleaf, and it will be received and installed by Goldleaf.\\n\\nKeep in mind that USB support is a bit unstable, and sometimes it might fail. Anyway, it should work most of the times.\\n\\nBasic controls\\nThe controls are quite intuitive in Goldleaf, but here you have a brief explanation of them:\\n\\nPress A to select options from menus, browse folders, or in case it's a file, to browse a menu with file options (copy, delete...)\\n\\nPress B to cancel a dialog or to go back to the previous page / menu.\\n\\nPress X to paste the path of the clipboard. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress Y to browse a menu with directory options, similar to the one used with files, instead of browsing the directory. Obviously, this option is only available on file browsers. (SD or NAND)\\n\\nPress ZL or ZR anywhere to browse a menu with reboot / shut down options, in case you want to reboot or shut down the console.\\n\\nPress Plus (+) or Minus (-) to exit Goldleaf and return to hbmenu. This option is only available if Goldleaf is loaded as a NRO binary. (more special cases like this one below)\\n\\nMovement is quite obvious. Using the L-stick, the R-stick or the D-pad you can move through menu or dialog options. On menus (like the file browsers or the main menu) the R-stick provides a way faster scrolling.\\n\\nSpecial features\\nGoldleaf differs on some features depending on whether it is loaded as a NRO or as an installed title:\\n\\nGoldleaf can be exited via Plus (+) or Minus (-) buttons if it's loaded as a NRO, but as regular titles have to be exited from the Home Menu, this feature is not available as a title.\\n\\nGoldleaf disables Home button pressing while installing a NSP if it's loaded as a title, but this feature isn't available as a NRO binary for technical reasons related to applets.\\n\\nGoldleaf cannot launch NRO binaries if it's loaded as a title due to technical reasons. They can only be launched from another NRO binary.\\n\\nIssues and support\\nIn case you find a bug or you need help with Goldleaf, you have several places to ask.\\n\\nMany errors are very common and can be misunderstood, and you should document a bit for some errors instead of directly calling them issues:\\n\\nIt's a common issue for some NSPs, although they are completely valid ones, being detected as wrong NSPs. Although they can be really wrong NSPs, it is usually caused by firmware mismatch. For instance, in case you are trying to install a title which requires at least 5.1.0 version (which uses key generation 4) on a lower firmware version, it won't be recognised as a valid NSP for cryptographical reasons. (the console cannot decrypt the NSP because it is encrypted with unknown keys which are within 5.1.0 update)\\n\\nThe USB installation can sometimes freeze in the middle of the install. If that happens, try closing Goldleaf and Goldtree, uninstalling the wrongly-installed title and retrying.",

Still use at your own risk on fat32, but just don't use it on exfat please.\\n\\nIntended for use on Switches that don't have AutoRCM installed.\\n\\nThis uses a new feature added to exosphere in Atmosphere 0.8.1, so it won't work in other CFWs unless they add it in a compatible way. Also Atmosphere 0.8.1 got a silent update with a bug fix to get this feature working, so if you already downloaded it before sometime on 1st Dec you might need to update it again (if it crashes with an orange screen instead of going to RCM, you need to update). There's a commit hash in the filename, make sure you have atmosphere-0.8.1-master-bd76e73 (or if you're living in the future, Atmosphere 0.8.2 or higher will be fine too). It sounds like it currently only works if you load Atmosphere using fusee-primary.bin, not if you use hekate to load Atmosphere as separate files (using hekate to load fusee-primary.bin is ok). This will likely be fixed when hekate is updated.\\n\\nThere are two versions included in the zip, each available as an .nro (put it in its folder inside the \"switch\" folder on the root of your sd card) and as an installable .nsp (install with the stupidly-named installer of your choice).\\n- RCMRebootInstant will reboot to RCM as soon as it loads.\\n- RCMReboot will give you a 5 second countdown with a chance to change your mind.\\n\\nThe reason RCMReboot is a much bigger file than the Instant version is that I used cpasjuste's cross2d library to put stuff on screen, mostly because I've been using it for the other project I'm working on and it saved me time. Sweet library, check it out.\\n\\nCredits to cpasjuste for the aforementioned cross2d, re.lax for nro2nsp (which uses hacbrewpack by the-4n), SciresM for Atmosphere, libnx, and for fixing the bugs in them I found while making this, and everyone else who worked on Atmosphere, libnx, devkitpro and all that good stuff.\\n\\nSource included for peace of mind, and in case of licence requirement. If I've got anything horribly wrong with licensing or credits just let me know. If you want to build it yourself you'll need libnx updated with the latest commit (which isn't in a release build at the time of writing), and to figure out the cross2d setup for the non-Instant version.",

            "details": "\\nThis is a homebrew that enables streaming of PC games to the Nintendo Switch!\\n\\nHave you ever been told by your parents that spending hours sitting in front of a PC was bad for you (like I was)? Well, now you can play your games portably anywhere in your house!\\n\\nThis project is fairly new, so please do not consider it totally stable. If you encounter issues, feel free to submit them.\\n\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n- Stream PC screen to a Nintendo Switch in your local network\\n- 720p (full Switch-Tablet display resolution)\\n- 40-60 FPS (if not see Troubleshooting)\\n- Low delay (again, see Troubleshooting)\\n- Capture controller input on Nintendo Switch\\n- Emulate an Xbox controller on the PC\\n- PC app offers picture quality adjustments\\n\\n\\nHow to Use:\\n\\nFor the PC App, you will need to execute In-Home-Switching.exe which you can download from:\\nhttps://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/releases\\n\\nOn PC, Scp drivers must also be installed (just unzip and execute Driver Installer/ScpDriverInstaller.exe). Otherwise the program will crash silently.\\n\\nAlso please set your PC resolution to 1280x720p in Windows for getting much better performance of screen capturing while running the app.\\n\\nOn the Switch, find out its IP address (in the Internet settings) and start the app with your Switch CFW. Then type in the Switch's IP address on the PC app and hit the Connect button.\\n\\n\\nCurrent Limitations:\\n\\n- Only works with Windows 8 (64-bit) and newer\\n- No audio support atm\\n- No support for Switch CFW other than Atmosph\u00e8re or Kosmos\\n\\n\\nKnown issues:\\n\\n- So far Switch crashes when put to sleep with app running (please close app beforehand, we have not fixed this issue yet)\\n- App breaks when Switch changes from docked to handheld mode or vice-versa. Please quit the app before doing so.\\n\\n\\nFurther notices:\\n\\nThis app uses core overclocking to 1785 MHz on the Nintendo Switch. We use this measure in order to decode the incoming videos efficiently. As far as we know, there have been no reported cases of this damaging any devices. In other words, it is considered safe. Still we do not warrant for any potential device damage caused by this homebrew.\\n\\n\\nTroubleshooting:\\n\\n-- Nice videos, but sadly that delay makes it unplayable --\\n\\nIf you are experiencing delays greater than 0.1 seconds, either your PC is just too slow for your chosen quality options (try worsening image quality) or your local network is bad. Basically we need instant data transfer in your network to work properly (this has nothing to do with throughput, just latency).\\nSome WiFi-routers unfortunately just aren't up to the task.\\n\\n-- These framedrops hurt my eyes! --\\n\\nYour PC is probably too slow for encoding with the games/applications on. Try other applications, lower image quality and, if you haven't already, set your PC screen resolution to 1280x720p (saves scaling).\\n\\n-- No drops, but my framerate is just very low --\\n\\nWell, in our tests we had 60 FPS on Windows 10 with low image quality... I guess you can try the same strategies as for fixing framedrops, I hope that helps.\\n\\n\\nLicense:\\n\\nThis code is licensed GPLv3 and this has a reason: We do not want to see (or read about) any parts of this project in non-open-source software (everything that is not GPLv3 licensed). Please share the notion of free code for everyone.\\n\\n\\nCredits to:\\n\\n- ffmpeg for being such a powerful media tool that we use on PC and Switch.\\n- SwitchBrew for libNX and its ffmpeg inclusion\\n- Atmosph\u00e8re for being such a great Switch CFW\\n- Captura for showing us how to capture frame input with Windows Duplication API\\n- simontime for his switch-usb-screen-stream-sharp project for Windows\\n- ScpDriverInterface for the Xbox drivers on Windows",

The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his fellow rabbits from slavery.\\n\\nHistory\\nLugaru was originally developed by David Rosen of Wolfire Games and was open sourced in 2010. It was made cross-platform with the help of Ryan C. Gordon.\\n\\nVarious forks were made at that time, and the most interesting developments were put back together under the OSS Lugaru organization, originally on Google Code and then on Bitbucket.\\n\\nThis new repository on GitLab is run by the same team, and aims at revitalizing the development effort to clean things up, ensuring the code base builds and runs fine on all supported platforms, and easing the packaging of Lugaru in Linux distributions.\\n\\nIdeally, the updated code base could also be used to update the Lugaru HD version sold by Wolfire Games once proven better than the current commercial builds.\\n\\nRun it through hbloader or hbmenu.nsp. Old Album method is not recommended (may cause crashes).\\nControls:\\nCheck in Options for current mapping. Press + to access menu (in-game).\\nNote that ZL and ZR are reserved for camera.",

When his aunt falls sick, Li travels across the sea to a mystical island in search of a cure for his aunt. He meets a maiden Zhao Ling'er, whom he falls in love with. Although he was forced by Zhao's nanny to marry Zhao and remain on the island forever, he manages to escape with the medicine and succeeds in healing his aunt. However, he loses memory of his encounter on the island because he was tricked into consuming a memory-erasing drug earlier. When he meets Zhao again, he does not remember her but still saves her from a group of enemies, who have destroyed her home and murdered her nanny. He then decides to accompany her to southwestern China in search of her mother, who might still be alive.\\n\\nMore info :\\nhttps://gbatemp.net/threads/legend-of-sword-and-fairy-freeware-english-1-1.491319",

Others will run much faster than they did before. Be warned that maximum overclock will probably heat up your Switch more than normal and extensive use might negatively affect your system.\\n\\nv0.4\\n\\n-Added screen rotation and screen layout settings; functionality is identical to desktop melonDS\\n-The emulation window is now drawn with OpenGL\\n-Having Vsync on is now just as fast as having it off\\n-Vsync option has been removed\\n\\nNOTE: Don't get too excited by the OpenGL! I'm only using it to draw the software renderer's output to the screen. There is NO speed boost from this right now. Yes, there is a bit of a speed boost in this build, but it has little to do with OpenGL.\\n\\nv0.3.1\\nFix sound output\\n\\nv0.3\\n\\nmelonDS was just bumped to version 0.7 a few hours ago, so here's another release from me as well! This release comes with an options menu containing four whole options (crazy, I know). I've also reworked some things to prevent flickering when navigating the menus.\\n\\nThe options added include:\\nBoot game directly - Disabling this will allow you to boot into the DS firmware instead of automatically running a game.\\nThreaded 3D renderer - Speeds up 3D rendering; you probably don't want to turn this off.\\nVsync - While not technically being Vsync, the functionality is similar enough. Disabling this will let the screen render without waiting for a frame to finish. It'll give you a performance increase at the cost of screen tearing and minor artifacts.\\nAudio output - Self-explanatory. Disable to sacrifice audio for a small performance boost.\\n\\nThe first two options are actual melonDS options, while the last two are custom ones I added for the purpose of increasing performance. You still probably won't get full speed, and the trade-offs may or may not be worth it, but at least it's something.\\n\\nv0.2\\n\\nThis release features the latest commits from upstream melonDS, which mainly feature the addition of experimental savestates. To use savestates on the Switch port, press L to save and R to load. You only get one slot per game. This is only temporary until I make some sort of actual menu system. Note that the DS L and R buttons are mapped to the Switch ZL and ZR buttons; don't get them mixed up!",

Now this is supported by redirecting savedata to files inside amiibo's \"areas\" directory.\\n\\nThis, in fact, provides another advantage, as real amiibos just allow savedata for one title, while this system allows to have multiple saves.\\n\\nAmiibo system changed\\n\\nFirst of all, don't worry. All amiibo BIN files found in emuiibo dir will be auto-converted to the new system.\\n\\nThe new system has every amiibo in a different directory, which contains the amiibo (\"amiibo.bin\"), a JSON metadata file (\"amiibo.json\"), an \"areas\" directory (see above) and a mii char-info copy (\"mii.dat\").\\n\\nOn this system everything can be customized. In order to change miis you would need the char-info data, which is stored inside the console. To help with this, emuiibo will dump all console miis inside \"miis\" directory in emuiibo dir, named with the index + mii name (example: \"0-XorTroll.dat\"). To use it, copy to the amiibo dir and name it as \"mii.dat\".\\n\\nAn interesting option can be added to the JSON (\"randomizeUuid\" boolean), which makes emuiibo randomize the amiibo UUID. Having this means special circumstances in certain games, like being recognized as a different amiibo each time in BotW, hence infinite supply.\\n\\nIMPORTANT! After using 0.2, since the old system gets changed to the new one, 0.1 won't find any amiibos as they're not on the root dir now. Thus, avoid using 0.1 after using 0.2.\\n\\nHOME button LED blink (7.x+, sadly)\\n\\nOn firmwares on 7.x or higher, performing a combo makes the HOME button blink, which is a simple and nice system to signal that a combo has been performed. Not supported on previous versions for technical limitations.\\nnfp:emu service changed, with new commands\\n\\nAlso, a remainder that the next Goldleaf version (0.6) is going to have emuiibo support, featuring real amiibo dumping to emuiibo-style and more!\\n\\n",

            "details": "I present to you my own original NES emulator for the Switch, NoiES! This entire emulator was written from scratch by me. I started this project just to teach myself about how emulators are made so that I can work on larger projects in the future, but it went farther than I originally expected and is now pretty much a full-fledged emulator, apart from some minor inaccuracies and some missing mappers.\\n\\nBut there are already other NES emulators for the Switch, why use this one?\\nWell, no reason in particular. As I said before, this was more a learning experience for me, but I ported it to the Switch for the homebrew bounty and I might as well release it. I suppose the biggest advantage I can offer is that since I developed the entire emulator core myself I am very familiar with it and can easily dive in to fix bugs and add new features.\\n\\nMinor inaccuracies?\\nYes, well, I've yet to test my CPU timing for cycle accuracy so no promises there. There are also some minor timing issues with the PPU, particularly with the MMC3 IRQ counter, which can be seen in the slight vibration of the status bar in Kirby's Adventure. Another odd bug I found is that I can't seem to navigate the items menu in The Legend of Zelda. Oh, and the audio system is still kind of a work in progress, so you might notice crackles (especially in docked mode!), missing sounds, or things that sound slightly off. (Wow, doing a great job selling it here)\\n\\nMappers?\\nRight. Every ROM has a mapper; it's basically what loads different portions of the ROM memory into the CPU memory for execution. I've implemented mappers 1 through 4, which should cover a large portion of the NES library. If you have any particular games you want to play that aren't supported, tell me the mapper number (the emulator will tell you which one it is if it isn't supported) so I can place higher priority on implementing it.",

Once it's enabled, you can access the bridge by pressing L+R on a valid game.\\nThis feature currently works only with LGPE.\\nFixed: buttons are now responsive as before while navigating the UI.\\nFixed: titles with black background are now displayed properly.\\nFixed: checkmark color doesn't confuse with title icons anymore.\\nFixed: text doesn't bleed textboxes like before anymore.\\n\\nv3.5\\n\\nAdded support for Hardware Acceleration. Checkpoint now relies on the GPU to render graphics and text, removing load from the CPU.\\nThe interface now relies on SDL2 to render images and text.\\nText rendering is optimized by using a customized version of SDL_FontCache which caches glyphs in memory rather than creating textures every frame. This also allows to use the system font already available in the console.\\nCheckpoint caches from PlSharedFontType_Standard and PlSharedFontType_NintendoExt fonts, so both regular characters and symbols are now supported to be rendered on screen.\\nAdded option to set a title as Favorite. You can now edit your configuration file to set a title id to be a favorite title, so this will always appear at the top of the title list.\\nFixed crashes caused by too many file descriptors opened.\\nKey behaviour changed. ( thanks @IBNobody )\\nYou can now select rows in the backup list, creating backups and restoring a backup just with the button A.\\nPressing Y will select the current title but deactivate/reset the backup list. It will also enable the backup touch button only. Creating a backup will then disable the backup touch button. This makes it more clear to the user what buttons / UI elements are relevant to multi-backup.\\nFixed occasional crashes while changing account.\\nCheckpoint now uses latest libnx 1.5.0, which supports timezone and fixes wrong default backup names if your console never connected to internet.\\nCheckpoint is now compiled using C++17.",

The UI has been designed to condense as many options as possible, while keeping it simple to work with.\\n\\nMoreover, Checkpoint is extremely lightweight - while being packaged with a nice graphic user interface - and is built using the most recent libraries available.\\n\\nCheckpoint for Switch natively supports NAND saves for the titles you have played. Title information are loaded automatically.\\n\\nWorking path\\n\\nCheckpoint relies on the following folders to store the files it generates. Note that all the working directories are automatically generated on first launch (or when Checkpoint finds a new title that doesn't have a working directory yet).\\n\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint: root path\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/config.json: custom configuration file\\n - sdmc:/switch/Checkpoint/saves/<title id> <game title>: root path for all the save backups for a generic game\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nCheckpoint for Switch only runs on homebrew launcher. Make sure you're running up-to-date payloads.\\n\\nThe first launch will take considerably longer than usual (usually 1-2 minutes depending on how many titles you have installed), due to the working directories being created - Checkpoint will be significatively faster upon launch from then on.\\n\\nYou can scroll between the title list with the DPAD/LR and target a title with A when the selector is on it. Now, you can use the DPAD or the touchscreen to select a target backup to restore/overwrite.",

Also see README.install if you want to build the game from\\nsource code.\\n\\nNintendo Switch Port\\n====================\\n\\nThe Nintendo Switch port has been built using DevkitPro (https://devkitpro.org/)\\nand libnx (https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx).\\n\\nThe whole game should be playable, controls have been adapted to the\\nSwitch, including the use of the touch screen or the left joystick\\nand the A button as a mouse to navigate the menus.\\n\\nThe roster is not functional yet, as you cannot input text, so 4\\nplayers are created by default, which have assigned the corresponding\\ngamepad to their player number.\\n\\nThe default controls are:\\n- Up/Down: left joystick or directional pad\\n- Guns: Y button\\n- Bombs: B button\\n- Roll: X button\\n- Power: R button\\n- Exit/back: - button\\n- Help: + button\\n\\nTrademarks\\n==========\\n\\nTriplane Turmoil is a trademark of Dodekaedron Software\\nCreations Oy.\\n\\nTriplane Turmoil 2 is a trademark of Draconus Entertainment Ltd.\\n\\nTriplane Classic is not a trademark.

Thanks a lot!\\nGamecard base application icons are now retrieved and displayed in the menu.\\nL/ZL/R/ZR buttons can now be used to change the displayed base application info if a multigame cart is inserted, instead of displaying everything right away.\\nThe Nintendo Extension shared font is now used to display bitmaps representing controller buttons and sticks instead of just using text to reference them.\\nReplaced the mbedtls-based AES and SHA-256 implementations with functions from the hardware accelerated cryptography API from libnx.\\nAdded an option to generate split XCI dumps using a directory with the archive bit set, just like split NSP dumps. It will only appear if \"Split output dump\" is enabled.\\nFixed ETA calculation.\\nEnabled ETA calculation in full HFS0 partition data dumps.\\nFixed CRC32 checksum calculation for gamecard certificate dumps.\\nAdded Program NCA RomFS section parser:\\nSupports filesystem dumping, filesystem browsing, manual file dumping and file splitting. Enjoy datamining your gamecards!\\nCompatible with multigame carts. You'll be able to choose which base application RomFS will be dumped/browsed from a submenu.\\nOutput files will be saved to: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) (RomFS)/\".\\nAdded high contrast directory/file icons from GNOME project to file browsing modes (HFS0 / RomFS).\\nFixed the NSP generation code (based on 4NXCI / hacPack):\\nDelta Fragment NCAs are now discarded.\\nThe SHA-256 checksum is recalculated for every NCA content after being modified, resulting in new NCA IDs.\\nThe ACID public key is replaced in the NPDM section from the Program NCA. All the related NCA/PFS0 Superblock SHA-256 hashes are recalculated.\\nThe NPDM signature in the Program NCA header is now replaced as well.\\nThe content records from the Application CNMT are updated with proper SHA-256 hashes and new NCA IDs. All the related NCA/PFS0 Superblock hashes are recalculated.\\nNACP XMLs are now generated as well.\\nBecause of all these changes, the CRC32 checksum can't be calculated until the dump procedure is complete.\\nIf this option is enabled, the application will take extra time after the NSP dump has been completed to calculate the CRC32 checksum. Nonetheless, you'll be able to cancel this procedure.\\nA warning message will appear in the NSP dump menu if CRC32 checksum calculation is enabled to inform the user about this extra step.\\nFurthermore, the output CRC32 checksum will be different on each new dump. This is because the NPDM signature in the Program NCA header uses a random seed.\\nThis effectively makes the generated NSPs only need ES patches to work. ACID patches shouldn't be needed anymore.\\nAdded NSP dumping support for Patch and AddOnContent title types with gamecards that include bundled Updates/DLCs:\\nThe information displayed in the main menu now shows how many Updates/DLCs are bundled in the inserted gamecard (per application and in total).\\nIf a bundled gamecard update features a populated Rights ID bitfield, both its Ticket and Certificate will get added to the output NSP.\\nAdditionally, the NSP dump menu has been divided in three subcategories: base application, update and DLC.\\nEach submenu will only appear if the inserted gamecard holds at least one title belonging to the category it represents.\\nIf only the base application is included, like most gamecards, choosing the NSP dump option in the main menu will take you right to the base application dump menu.\\nOnce you enter a submenu, you'll be able to choose exactly which title to dump belonging to that category.\\nOutput update NSPs will not be modified in any way. Thus, unlike NSPs from base applications and DLCs, their CRC32 checksums will always be the same.\\nFixed the minimum system version field size in the extended CNMT header struct. Thanks to @0Liam !\\nChanged the naming convention for output NSP dumps:\\nBase application: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) (BASE).nsp\".\\nUpdate: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[UpdateVersion] ([UpdateTitleID]) (UPD).nsp\".\\nIf a matching base application isn't found: \"sdmc:/[UpdateTitleID] v[UpdateVersion] (UPD).nsp\".\\nDLC: \"sdmc:/[GameName] v[DLCVersion] ([DLCTitleID]) (DLC).nsp\".\\nIf a matching base application isn't found: \"sdmc:/[DLCTitleID] v[DLCVersion] (DLC).nsp\".\\nThe application is now able to retrieve the NCA header key and perform NCA key area decryption at runtime, using the SPL services. Thus, is isn't needed to run Lockpick beforehand anymore to dump NSPs (nor to dump/browse RomFS data).\\nIf the inserted gamecard includes a bundled update, its version number will now be used in the output filename for XCI, HFS0 and gamecard certificate dumps.\\nMinor improvements to the file splitting code.\\nAdditionally, the filename for the current part will now be displayed and updated for all operations if file splitting is enabled.\\nThe application update feature will now use the launch path from argv if it's available. Otherwise, it defaults to \"sdmc:/switch/gcdumptool.nro\".\\nCosmetic fixes to the UI layout.\\nNCM service resources are now properly closed.\\nRemoved unnecessary service (de)initializations.\\n\\nv1.0.8\\n\\nAdded proper metadata reading from multigame carts.\\nAdded gamecard -> NSP dump option:\\nCompatible with file splitting (for FAT32 support). The same layout from splitNSP.py is used: a directory with numbered part files (00, 01, etc.). The archive bit is enabled right away in this directory to allow HOS to treat it as if it were a whole file. This way, it can be used with any application with NSP-handling capabilities.\\nCompatible with CRC32 checksum calculation. Disclaimer: NSP dumps can't be verified against the XML database.\\nOutput NSPs contain a metadata XML file based on the information from the CNMT NCA for the application, which is decrypted using code from hactool. The necessary keyset is loaded from \"sdmc:/switch/prod.keys\", which can be generated using Lockpick.\\nIf a multigame cart is used, you'll be able to choose which application to dump from the menu.\\nDump verification process tweaked for multigame carts: it'll now look for a possible checksum match using the Title IDs from all bundled applications.\\nImproved error reporting in dumper.c when a write operation fails. Furthermore, if a write error is produced when trying to write data to an offset past the FAT32 file size limit (0xFFFFFFFF bytes), the application will suggest the user to enable the file splitting option.\\nTweaked part sizes for splitted dumps: XCI/raw partition/manual file dump part size now matches the one used by XCI-Cutter, while the NSP part size matches the one used by splitNSP.py.\\nMinor fixes to the UI code.\\n\\nv1.0.7\\n\\nFixed a segmentation fault when trying to free an invalid XML node data pointer when a Scene release from NSWReleases.xml with a matching Title ID misses data related to that node.\\nAdded a message suggesting the user to restart the application after a successful update.\\n\\nv1.0.6\\n\\nUpdated application codebase in order to make it compatible with the latest devkitA64 and libnx releases.\\nRemoved some fs-srv service functions from fsext.c/h that have been included in libnx (and fixed the ones that haven't).\\nRevamped the GFX code to replace the 8x8 ASCII font with the shared system font, using the pl service and FreeType.\\nEnabled (and fixed) the in-app update option. HTTPS compatibility is achieved through the mbedtls portlib.\\nDisabled screen dimming and auto sleep.\\nAdded file counter to partition browser.\\nChanged the naming convention for split gamecard dumps to *.xc[part number], in order to make them compatible with SX OS and other tools right away.\\nIncreased the delay after inserting a new gamecard by 1 second.\\nAdded a gamecard detection thread to monitor gamecard state changes in a better way. This thread is hooked to a gamecard detection kernel handle retrieved through an IEventNotifier object.\\nReplaced partition filesystem mounting through fs-srv service calls with manual HFS0 partition header parsing. This should fix issues when browsing the Logo partition from type 0x02 gamecards.\\nBlocked HOME button presses when running as a regular/system application instead of an applet. A warning message will be displayed whenever any operation is started if the application is running as an applet.\\nAdded detection for bundled FW versions 6.0.0 - 8.0\\n\\nv1.0.5:\\n\\nFixed game card version reading (now using the ncm service instead of retrieving it from the cached Control.nacp).\\nAdded ability to read and identify FW update versions bundled with game cards.\\nIn case an error occurs while reading the game card Title ID, the application will also display the FW version update bundled with it along with an explanation.\\nRemoved output XCI dump renaming based on the XML database from nswdb.com.\\nOutput naming scheme changed. Characters out of the ASCII range are replaced with underscores:\\nXCI dump: 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]).xci'.\\nRaw partition dump: 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) - Partition [PartitionIndex] ([PartitionName]).hfs0'.\\nPartition data dump (directory): 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) - Partition [PartitionIndex] ([PartitionName])/'.\\nCertificate dump: 'sdmc:/[GameName] v[GameVersion] ([TitleID]) - Certificate ([CRC32]).bin'.\\nManual file dumps will now be saved to their corresponding directory instead of the SD card root.\\nAdded a XML database update option in the main menu.\\nAdded an update application option in the main menu. It isn't working at this moment because libcurl has problems dealing with secure connections, and as such the option has been disabled (pressing A on it does nothing). Nonetheless, the code to parse JSON responses from the GitHub API is pretty much ready, so it's just a matter of time.",

The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language was written by Charles Kapps[citation needed], who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nFeatures :\\n\\n- U can use differents accounts for play.\\n- Highscores\\n- Tactil\\nControls : - Double Touch or D-pad + A : Menu Selection - Short Touch or Short A : enable color - - : Back to menu - : Restart game - Plus : Exit game",

Subsequent boots are much faster.\\n\\n# Controls\\n\\nLeft analog stick = mouse pointer control\\nRight analog stick = scroll the map\\nR = left mouse click\\nL = right mouse click\\nZR = hold to slow down analog joystick mouse, useful to precisely position the pointer\\nZL = hold to speed up analog joystick mouse\\nA = right mouse click\\nB = left mouse click\\nY = shift key, hold and move mouse up/down to build above the ground\\nX = ctrl key, hold and move mouse to build multiple pieces at the same height above ground\\nDpad up = zoom out (page up key)\\nDpad down = zoom in (page down key)\\nDpad left = close topmost window (backspace key)\\nDpad right = exit construction mode (escape key)\\nR3 (press right stick in) = open cheat menu (ctrl-alt-c)\\nMinus = toggle between three touch control modes:\\nTouchpad style drag pointer with finger and tap to click, default:\\nMove a single finger to move the mouse pointer. Use short tap for left click. Hold a single finger while tapping a second finger for right click. Drag with two fingers to drag and drop.\\nJump to finger without click\\nThe pointer jumps to the finger, but the finger doesn't click. Use L/R or A/B to click\\nJump to finger with tap click\\nThe pointer jumps to the finger, and a short tap also generates a left click\\nPlus = bring up on-screen keyboard, useful for entering names, etc.\\nWhen pressing enter, it first erases existing text and replaces it with new text\\nPhysical USB keyboard and mouse are supported. Not all mice work. There's a mouse compatibility\\nchart.\\n\\nSee :\\n\\nhttps://github.com/rsn8887/openrct2/releases/latest for detailed installation instructions.\\n\\nThis is an initial appstore release and may include the full game in time.",

While there's a way to extricate tsec_root_key due to the way it's used, this is unfortunately not true of the package1 key\\nIf for some reason you dump TSEC keys on 6.2.0 and not fuses (secure_boot_key) you will still get everything except any of the package1 or keyblob keys (without secure_boot_key, you can't decrypt keyblobs and that's where package1 keys live)",

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink for more info.\\n\\nI discovered the game a few years ago on the Nintendo DS with 'Puzzle Series Vol. 5: Slitherlink', which was never released outside of Japan. It's such a good game I became addicted to it, just like with Picross and Nurikabe.\\n\\nThis is my version of the game for the Nintendo Switch. It's a rewrite of one of my previous projects for the Dingoo A320. It features 456 levels in four sizes: 5x5 (easy), 7x7, 10x10, 20x20 (hard). There's also a save state function, undo button, and more.\\n\\nRules\\nIn SlitherlinkNX, you draw lines on a grid to create a meandering path, following the rules:\\n\\nThe path must form a single loop, without crossing itself or branching.\\nThe numbers indicate how many lines surround each cell. Empty cells may be surrounded by any number of lines.\\nThere is one unique solution for each level. You can draw small x's on segments that cannot be connected. You should be able to find the solution by logical deduction only, without guessing.\\n\\nFor Slitherlink beginners, I strongly recommend to consult the Wikipedia page, especially chapter 'Solution methods', which is a big help at the start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink#Solution_methods\\n\\nControls\\nd-pad: move cursor\\nX/A/B/Y: draw a line, then a cross, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nL + X/A/B/Y: draw a cross, then a line, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nR: undo previous action\\n+: open menu, allowing to: retry, save state, or quit\\n\\nCredits\\nDevelopment: Tardigrade (http://beyondds.free.fr/)\\nOriginal game: Nikoli (http://www.nikoli.com/)\\nPuzzles: Krazydad (http://www.krazydad.com/slitherlink/)\\nFont: Chopin Script\\nSounds: Junggle\\nBackground: aopsan",

While 720p should be mostly fine, 1080p support can vary with medias and bit rates. If so (audio de-sync for example), increasing buffering can help in most situation. This can be done in the main menu (left). Please note that increasing the buffer size will have some side effect like longer loading and seeking time, but also to stop a video (buffers needs to be released). This is more visible when using http streams, of course.\\n\\npPlay can stream media from an http server with directory listing enabled. To do so, you must edit the pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg) to add your server address (NETWORK = 'http://samples.ffmpeg.org/';). Please note that you need a good and stable network connection for this, and you will probably have to set buffering to \"VeryHigh\" for smoother experience.\\n\\npPlay will extract media information in background, but i did spot a very few files which make the device crash. If so, you can disable this in pPlay configuration file (pplay.cfg): CACHE_MEDIA_INFO = 0;\\n\\npPlay will push the cpu speed when a 1080p media is played, and restore previous speed when paused or stopped. This is safe but can be disabled in the main option menu (left).\\n\\nPlease note that there is a (big?) delay when switching video/audio/subtitles streams to see the change. This is worked on but in the meantime, be patient :)",
